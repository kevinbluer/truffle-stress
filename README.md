# Teams Stress ðŸ˜±

A [Truffle](https://trufflesuite.com/) project designed to "stress out" Truffle Teams...specifically the debugger (for now) in the following ways:

- Relatively large number of files (all starting with the same filenames)
- Relatively long files (although these could be a lot longer)

Free to add more scenarios ðŸ‘Œ

## Usage

- [Add to teams](https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/teams/getting-started/adding-repositories)
